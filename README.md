*Overview of Data Pipelines*

Data pipelines play a crucial role in efficiently managing and processing data within modern systems. These pipelines typically involve five key phases: Collection, Ingestion, Storage, Computation, and Consumption.

*Collection:*
Data is sourced from various outlets, including data stores, streams, and applications, often originating remotely from devices, applications, or business systems.

*Ingestion:*
In the ingestion phase, data is loaded into systems and systematically organized within event queues.

*Storage:*
Following ingestion, well-organized data finds its place in data warehouses, data lakes, and data lakehouses, as well as various systems like databases, ensuring reliable post-ingestion storage.

*Computation:*
Data undergoes aggregation, cleansing, and manipulation to adhere to company standards. This involves tasks such as format conversion, data compression, and partitioning. This phase employs a mix of batch and stream processing techniques.

*Consumption:*
Processed data becomes accessible for consumption through analytics and visualization tools, operational data stores, decision engines, user-facing applications, dashboards, data science, machine learning services, business intelligence, and self-service analytics.

The efficiency and effectiveness of each phase significantly contribute to the overall success of data-driven operations within an organization.
